MACHINE LEARNING is a very popular technique in Natural Language Processing. We can see it applied to get the polarity of social network posts, movie reviews, or even books.

However basic sentiment analysis can be limited, as we lack precision in the evoked subject.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a text analysis technique that breaks down text into aspects (attributes or components of a product or service), and then allocates each one a sentiment level (positive, negative or neutral).

If you thought sentiment analysis was pretty neat, then prepare to be blown away by this advanced text analysis technique, aspect-based sentiment analysis helps you get the most out of your data.

Imagine you have a large dataset of customer feedback from different sources such as NPS, customer satisfaction surveys, social media, and online reviews. Some positive, some negative and others that contain mixed feelings. You’d use sentiment analysis to automatically classify the polarity of each text, right? After all, it’s already proven to be a highly efficient tool.

But, what if you wanted to pick customer feedback apart, hone in on the details, get down to the nitty-gritty of each feedback for a more complete picture of your customers’ opinions?

​

Cue aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). This technique can help businesses become customer-centric and place their customers at the heart of everything they do. It’s about listening to their customers, understanding their voice, analyzing their feedback and learning more about customer experiences, as well as their expectations for products or services.
